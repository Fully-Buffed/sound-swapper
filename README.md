# sound-swapper
A simple tray tool that switches between audio devices and applies a corresponding EQ profile. Built in Python to explore system APIs and desktop utility development.

## ðŸ’¡ Learning Log
- **05-26-2025**: Learned how to use the terminal (Git Bash) to install packages using `pip`. I was aware of bash, but had never used it prior to today. I also learned the differences between built-in Python modules and third-party packages. Created GitHub repo from scratch, cloned it using Git, and manually structured the project folder. I'm using PyCharm to manage the project and run code locally. This is my first time building a project manually using Git, an IDE, and modular file organization.

- **05-27-2025**: I initially attempted to use comtypes.client.GetModule() to generate COM bindings for mmdeviceapi.dll and PolicyConfig.dll, but encountered DLL loading issues. The approach felt overly complex, so I pivoted to using pycaw and IMMDeviceEnumerator with ctypes. However, that too proved difficult to maintain and lacked clear documentation. Ultimately, I implemented a cleaner, more reliable solution by leveraging the PowerShell AudioDeviceCmdlets module, called through Pythonâ€™s subprocess module. This allowed me to list playback devices, detect the current default output device, and switch between them with the functionality wrapped in a reusable AudioDeviceManager class.

- **05-30-2025**: Created the ProfileManager class to handle dynamic profile configuration for Sound Swapper. The goal is to allow users to select their audio devices and optional EQ scripts via the UI dynamically. I designed it to auto-load or create a config.json file to store device mappings so the program is flexible across users.
