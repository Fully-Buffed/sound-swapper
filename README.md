## ðŸ’¡ Learning Log
- **2025-05-26**: Learned how to use the terminal (Git Bash) to install packages using `pip`. I was aware of bash, but had never used it 
- prior to today. I also learned the differences between built-in Python modules and third-party packages. Created GitHub repo from scratch, 
- cloned it using Git, and manually structured the project folder. I'm using PyCharm to manage the project and run code locally. 
- This is my first time building a project manually using Git, an IDE, and modular file organization.
